## TODO

[ ] I have a gpt3 script which I need to add to this pipeline more clearly. We can
discuss this. 
[ ] Plotting
[ ] Compiling results
[ ] add M1 compatibility (there seems to be radically different outputs)
[ ] Models with mismatching tokenizer and model   

Refactoring 

[ ] Clarify the experimental class and reduce repeated code
[ ] Consider encapsulating model versions 
[ ] For experimental classes, clarify the format of the data and accessing it.
        this will have reflexes on plotting that might make it easier 
[ ] More fully integrate the language flag
[ ] Custom alignment protocols (could refactor this)
[ ] Reconsider how to integrate code with Marty's lab
